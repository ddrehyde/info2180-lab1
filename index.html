        <p>Hello, my name is De'Andre Hyde, also called "Lenny" by friends. I love playing video games, listening to music, cooking, and anything technology-wise. I'm Especially interested in the hardware side of technology as I am fascinated by how devices work on a more intricate level so studying computer science helps me to gain further knowledge on how technology operates. </p>
